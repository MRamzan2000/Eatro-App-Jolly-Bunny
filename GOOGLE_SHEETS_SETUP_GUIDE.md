# Google Sheets Recipe App Setup Guide

## Overview
Your recipe app now loads all recipe data dynamically from Google Sheets! This allows you to add, edit, and manage hundreds of recipes without redeploying the app.

## Step 1: Create Your Google Sheet

1. **Create a new Google Sheet** at [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)

2. **Set up the column headers** in row 1 exactly as shown:
   ```
   A1: Recipe Name
   B1: Cuisine
   C1: Meal Type
   D1: Image URL
   E1: Description
   F1: Instructions
   ```

3. **Add your sample recipes** starting from row 2. Here are your 6 current recipes formatted for the sheet:

## Step 2: Make Your Sheet Public

1. **Click "Share"** in the top-right corner of your Google Sheet
2. **Click "Change to anyone with the link"**
3. **Set permission to "Viewer"**
4. **Copy the share link** - it will look like:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BvDYd8C7XwA8B9C0D1E2F3G4H5I6J7K8L9M0N1O2P3Q4R5S6T7U8V9W0X1Y2Z3/edit?usp=sharing
   ```

5. **Extract the Sheet ID** from the URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`):
   ```
   1BvDYd8C7XwA8B9C0D1E2F3G4H5I6J7K8L9M0N1O2P3Q4R5S6T7U8V9W0X1Y2Z3
   ```

## Step 3: Get Google Sheets API Key

1. **Go to** [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Create a new project** or select an existing one
3. **Enable the Google Sheets API**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. **Create an API Key**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - Copy your API key (it will look like: `AIzaSyBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ1234567890`)

## Step 4: Update Your App Configuration

1. **Open** `src/services/googleSheetsService.ts`

2. **Replace the placeholder values** with your actual credentials:
   ```typescript
   const SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE'; // Replace with your actual Sheet ID
   const API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace with your actual API key
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```typescript
   const SHEET_ID = '1BvDYd8C7XwA8B9C0D1E2F3G4H5I6J7K8L9M0N1O2P3Q4R5S6T7U8V9W0X1Y2Z3';
   const API_KEY = 'AIzaSyBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ1234567890';
   ```

3. **Save the file** and restart your development server

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

1. **Restart your development server** (`npm run dev`)
2. **Check the browser console** for any error messages
3. **Use the "Refresh" button** in the app to manually reload recipes from Google Sheets
4. **Add a new recipe** to your Google Sheet and refresh to see it appear

## Adding New Recipes

Once set up, you can easily add new recipes:

1. **Add a new row** to your Google Sheet with recipe data
2. **Fill in all columns**: Recipe Name, Cuisine, Meal Type, Image URL, Description, Instructions
3. **Click the "Refresh" button** in your app (or wait 5 minutes for automatic refresh)
4. **See new recipes appear** immediately without redeploying

## Image URLs

For the Image URL column, you can use:
- **Pexels**: Free stock photos (e.g., `https://images.pexels.com/photos/1640777/pexels-photo-1640777.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=400`)
- **Unsplash**: Free stock photos
- **Your own images**: Upload to Google Drive, Dropbox, or any image hosting service
- **Recipe websites**: Direct links to recipe images (ensure they allow hotlinking)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Unable to Load Recipes"**: Check that your Sheet ID and API Key are correct
2. **"No data found"**: Ensure your sheet is public and has data starting from row 2
3. **Missing recipe data**: Check that all columns are filled correctly
4. **API quota exceeded**: Google Sheets API has usage limits; the app caches data for 5 minutes to reduce calls

### Tips:

- **Keep your API key secure** - don't share it publicly
- **Use the sample recipes** as a template for formatting
- **Test with a few recipes first** before adding hundreds
- **Use consistent image sizes** for better visual appearance
- **Keep descriptions concise** but informative

## Scaling to Hundreds of Recipes

For large recipe collections:

1. **Organize by categories** using multiple sheets within the same Google Sheets document
2. **Use consistent formatting** for all entries
3. **Consider using a CDN** for images if you have many recipes
4. **Monitor API usage** in Google Cloud Console

## Security Notes

- **API Key**: Keep your API key private and don't commit it to public repositories
- **Sheet Access**: Only make your sheet public if you're comfortable with the data being visible
- **Rate Limits**: Google Sheets API has quotas; the app includes caching to minimize requests

Your recipe app now supports unlimited recipes managed entirely through Google Sheets! ðŸŽ‰
